    <h1>
    <div id="blur">
        <span id="two">The universe (which others call the Library) is composed of an indefinite and perhaps infinite number of hexagonal galleries, with vast air shafts between, surrounded by very low railings. </span> <p onclick="myFunction(this, 'white')">From any of the hexagons one can see, interminably, the upper and lower floors.</p> <span id="eight">The distribution of the galleries is invariable.</span> <p onclick="myFunction(this, 'white')">Twenty shelves, five long shelves per side, cover all the sides except two; their height, which is the distance from floor to ceiling, scarcely exceeds that of a normal bookcase.</p> <span id="one">One of the free sides leads to a narrow hallway which opens onto another gallery, identical to the first and to all the rest.</span> <p onclick="myFunction(this, 'white')">To the left and right of the hallway there are two very small closets. In the first, one may sleep standing up; in the other, satisfy one's fecal necessities. Also through here passes a spiral stairway, which sinks abysmally and soars upwards to remote distances.</p> <span id="three">In the hallway there is a mirror which faithfully duplicates all appearances. Men usually infer from this mirror that the Library is not infinite (if it were, why this illusory duplication?); I prefer to dream that its polished surfaces represent and promise the infinite... Light is provided by some spherical fruit which bear the name of lamps.</span> <p onclick="myFunction(this, 'white')">There are two, transversally placed, in each hexagon. The light they emit is insufficient, incessant.</p>

        <span id="four"> Like all men of the Library, I have traveled in my youth; I have wandered in search of a book, perhaps the catalogue of catalogues; now that my eyes can hardly decipher what I write, I am preparing to die just a few leagues from the hexagon in which I was born.</span> <p onclick="myFunction(this, 'white')">Once I am dead, there will be no lack of pious hands to throw me over the railing; my grave will be the fathomless air; my body will sink endlessly and decay and dissolve in the wind generated by the fall, which is infinite.</p> <span id="five">I say that the Library is unending. </span> <p onclick="myFunction(this, 'white')">The idealists argue that the hexagonal rooms are a necessary form of absolute space or, at least, of our intuition of space.</p> <span id="seven">They reason that a triangular or pentagonal room is inconceivable.</span> <p onclick="myFunction(this, 'white')">(The mystics claim that their ecstasy reveals to them a circular chamber containing a great circular book, whose spine is continuous and which follows the complete circle of the walls; but their testimony is suspect; their words, obscure. This cyclical book is God.)</p> <span id="six">Let it suffice now for me to repeat the classic dictum: The Library is a sphere whose exact center is any one of its hexagons and whose circumference is inaccessible.</span>
